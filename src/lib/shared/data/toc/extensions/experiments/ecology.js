			fullDesc: [
				'The ECOSTRESS instrument was launched to the International Space Station in 2018 and measures the temperature of plants and the land surface to within a few tenths of a degree Celsius. The data collected by ECOSTRESS can be used to determine the amount of water that plants are using and the level of stress they are experiencing, as well as providing information on droughts and heat waves.',
				'ECOSTRESS is also capable of measuring the temperature of cities, and can help scientists understand the urban heat island effect - where cities can be several degrees warmer than surrounding rural areas due to the materials used in construction and the lack of vegetation.',
				"The mission is a collaboration between NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the University of Arizona, and is part of NASA's Earth Science Division. ECOSTRESS data is freely available to the public and can be used for a variety of applications, including improving agricultural water management and understanding the impact of climate change on ecosystems."

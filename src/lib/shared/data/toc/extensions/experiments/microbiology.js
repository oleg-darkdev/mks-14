			fullDesc: [
				'The goal of the Nanobiosym Genes experiment was to develop a portable, real-time diagnostic platform capable of identifying infectious disease markers in biological samples aboard the International Space Station (ISS). The platform uses a combination of nanotechnology, microfluidics, and genomic analysis to detect and diagnose infectious diseases quickly and accurately.',
				'Traditional methods of diagnosing infectious diseases often involve sending biological samples to a laboratory on Earth for analysis, which can take days or even weeks. However, in spaceflight missions, such a delay can be detrimental to the health of the crew members. Therefore, the development of a diagnostic tool that can be used in real-time in space is essential.',
				"During the Nanobiosym Genes experiment, samples of E. coli bacteria were used to test the device's ability to detect and diagnose infectious disease markers. The device was able to successfully identify the bacteria and provide accurate diagnoses in real-time, demonstrating its potential usefulness in spaceflight missions.",
				"The Nanobiosym Genes experiment was conducted by Dr. Anita Goel, a physician, physicist, and entrepreneur, and her team from Nanobiosym, a biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The project was supported by NASA's ISS National Laboratory, the Center for Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS), and the Canadian Space Agency.",
				'The successful demonstration of the Nanobiosym Genes device on the ISS represents an important step toward the development of more advanced diagnostic tools for spaceflight missions, which will enable crew members to diagnose and treat infectious diseases in real-time, without having to wait for samples to be returned to Earth for analysis.'

			fullDesc: [
				'The Veggie facility, developed by Orbital Technologies Corporation (ORBITEC) in Madison, Wisconsin, was designed to study the in-orbit growth of fresh produce using LED lighting technology. The Veggie hardware includes a flat panel light bank that includes red, blue, and green LEDs for plant growth and crew observation.',
				'The objective of the Veg-01 experiment was to validate the Veggie hardware by growing Outredgeous lettuce, a type of red romaine lettuce, and comparing it to the growth of the same lettuce on Earth. The experiment also aimed to assess the microbial quality of the lettuce, and to assess crew comfort with the hardware.',
				'Six plant pillows containing the Outredgeous lettuce seeds were inserted into the Veggie facility and activated after four days. The lettuce was grown for 33 days before being harvested and placed in cold storage for the return trip to Earth. After being returned to Earth, the lettuce was analyzed for microbial content and nutrient content, and compared to a control group of Outredgeous lettuce grown on Earth under similar conditions.',
				'The results of the experiment showed that the lettuce grew well in the Veggie facility, and had similar nutrient content to Earth-grown lettuce. The Veggie-grown lettuce had a higher microbial content than Earth-grown lettuce, but was still within safe levels for consumption. Crew feedback was positive, and the Veg-01 experiment paved the way for future space vegetable production experiments.'

			fullDesc: [
				'Multi-Omics Analysis of Human-Microbial Metabolic Cross-Talk in Space (MOHMM) is a comprehensive study of the interaction between human and microbial metabolism in space. The experiment aims to understand how microgravity affects human-microbial interactions and metabolism by analyzing changes in gene expression, protein levels, and metabolites in both human cells and microbial communities.',
				'MOHMM is conducted using the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware, which provides controlled temperature and lighting conditions for growing cells and microbes in space. The experiment uses a combination of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics techniques to analyze changes in gene expression, protein levels, and metabolites in human cells and microbial communities.',
				'The data generated from MOHMM will help scientists understand how microgravity affects human-microbial interactions and metabolism, which has important implications for long-duration spaceflight and the health of astronauts. The study could also have broader implications for human health on Earth, as many microbial communities in the human body play a critical role in maintaining health and preventing disease.',
				"MOHMM was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX's CRS-20 mission in March 2020 and is scheduled to run for several months. The experiment is being conducted by a team of researchers from the University of California, Davis, and NASA's Ames Research Center."

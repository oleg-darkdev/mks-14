				'The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is equipped with two main instruments: the Large Area Telescope (LAT) and the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). The LAT is a state-of-the-art detector that can detect gamma rays with energies ranging from 20 million to more than 300 billion electron volts. The GBM is a set of 14 detectors that can detect gamma-ray bursts, which are short-lived bursts of gamma rays that are some of the most powerful explosions in the universe.',
				'The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has made numerous important discoveries since its launch, including the detection of gamma-ray emissions from the Crab Nebula, the identification of the first gamma-ray binary system, and the detection of gamma-ray emissions from the center of our Milky Way galaxy. The telescope continues to operate and make new discoveries, and is expected to remain in operation until at least the mid-2020s.'

				'The Light Microscopy Module (LMM) experiment is a facility on the ISS that allows researchers to study the behavior of fluids and other materials in microgravity. The LMM includes two microscopes that are capable of producing high-resolution images of biological and physical systems.',
				'The LMM is designed to support a range of scientific investigations, including research into the formation and behavior of colloids, the growth of crystals, and the behavior of fluids in the absence of gravity. Scientists have used the LMM to study a wide range of biological and physical phenomena, including the behavior of living cells, the crystallization of proteins, and the formation of bubbles in fluids.',
				'The LMM has been used in a number of experiments aimed at advancing our understanding of the physical and biological processes that govern life on Earth. By studying these processes in microgravity, scientists hope to gain new insights into the fundamental laws of nature, and to develop new technologies and materials that could benefit people on Earth.'

			fullDesc: [
				'ACES was a joint project of the European Space Agency and the French space agency CNES, in collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). The experiment involved sending two highly stable atomic clocks to the International Space Station, where they were used to perform precision measurements of time and frequency.',
				"One of the goals of the experiment was to test whether atomic clocks could be used as a tool for performing high-precision measurements of gravity. By comparing the frequency of the atomic clocks in orbit to those on the ground, scientists were able to detect tiny differences in the gravitational field of the Earth, as well as the gravitational redshift effect predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity.",
				"In addition to testing the clocks themselves, the ACES experiment also involved studying the impact of the space environment on the clocks' performance. This included investigating the effects of temperature variations, radiation, and other environmental factors on the clocks' frequency stability and accuracy.",
				'The results of the ACES experiment have important implications for a range of scientific and technological applications, including GPS navigation, satellite-based geodesy, and tests of fundamental physics.'
